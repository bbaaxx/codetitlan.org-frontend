# Codetitlan.org frontend

This is an open source [Ember js](http://emberjs.com) based online-magazine application with
a very specific function: Publish articles categorized in sections and subsections.

In the future it may just evolve into a full featured publishing system but for now
the plan is to use it first as the frontend for the [Codetitlan.org](http://codetitlan.org)
website and publish there a series of tutorials about how we are building the app.

It is being built using [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) and I'm trying to document
everything I find useful for taming this amazing tool so feel free to look around the code
for some examples.

As everything related to Codetitlan, this code is and will always be open source.

## Current version
* 0.0.2 - Very primitive functionality and basic wiring

## In the near future
* Version 0.1.0
  * Article editing and publishing
  * Section and subsection creation
  * Article categorization by section and subsection
  * Default styling based on [Google's Material Design specs](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design)
  * Some reusable components to implement material design elements

## Contributing
Feel free to fork away and submit issues. 
PR contributions are also very welcome, please have a look at the task lists on the issues.
